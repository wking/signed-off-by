    SubmittingPatches: mention the usage of real name in Signed-off-by: lines

    Especially with something that is supposed to hopefully have some legal
    value down the line if somebody starts making noises, it really would be
    nice to have a real person to associate things with. Suggest this in the
    SubmittingPatches document.
